To solve this problem effectively, and for deeper understanding of the principles involved, here's what you need to focus on:
Key Concepts to Study:

    Dynamic Programming (DP):
        This is a crucial technique in combinatorics and optimization problems. In this context, you're calculating the number of ways to reach a target sum (spiciness level).
        Knapsack-like problems: Your problem is related to the "unbounded knapsack problem," where you need to find combinations to reach a sum using values that can be repeated.
        Coin Change Problem: This is a classical problem that can help you better understand how to solve such problems.

    Combination vs. Permutation:
        Combinations are selections where the order does not matter. Here, we’re interested in combinations where the total sum of spiciness values equals the target.
        Understanding the difference between unique combinations and repeated arrangements is key, especially when allowing items to be reused.

    Subset Sum Problem:
        This is closely related to your problem. It asks whether a subset of a set of numbers can sum to a specific target. You are essentially finding all subsets (with repetition allowed) that sum to the target.

    Memoization and Tabulation:
        Memoization stores intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations in recursive solutions.
        Tabulation is the bottom-up approach used in your code (storing solutions for smaller subproblems in an array and building them up to the target).

How to Study:
1. Dynamic Programming:

    Books: "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al. has a great introduction to dynamic programming.
    Online resources:
        Dynamic Programming by GeeksforGeeks
        Dynamic programming tutorials on YouTube, like those by Abdul Bari or NeetCode.
        Practice DP problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.

2. Subset Sum and Knapsack Problems:

    GeeksforGeeks: Search for problems like Coin Change Problem, 0/1 Knapsack, and Subset Sum. They usually come with detailed explanations and solutions.
    LeetCode Problems:
        Problem #518: Coin Change 2.
        Problem #377: Combination Sum IV (This one is especially similar to your problem).

3. Practicing Similar Problems:

    Try coding problems on LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks that involve combination sums, knapsack, or coin change.
    Platforms like Exercism.io and Codewars can also offer small coding exercises for problem-solving techniques.

Your Specific Problem Breakdown:
Steps to Solve:

    Understand what needs to be solved: You want the number of combinations (not permutations) where the sum of spiciness equals the target, allowing snack reuse.

    Dynamic programming approach:
        Use a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to form a spiciness level of i.
        Initialize dp[0] = 1 because there is one way to make a total of 0 spiciness (by choosing nothing).
        For each spiciness level from 1 to targetSpiciness, try to add each snack’s spiciness value, checking if it can contribute to the current total.

    Understand why the answer is 3, not 7:
        You’re looking for combinations of snacks, so order doesn’t matter. This is why some solutions (like rearranging the same items) should not be double-counted.
